# Week 4

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

This week, we explored the following key Python concepts:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Learned how to structure code using classes and objects to make it modular and reusable.

- **Applied OOP:**  
  Practiced using classes to simulate real-world problems.

- **Databases:**  
  Introduced to databases and how Python connects to them to store and retrieve data.

- **Modules, Packages, and Unit Tests:**  
  Learned how to structure Python code into reusable modules and packages.  
  Also, learned how to write unit tests to ensure code behaves as expected.

## ðŸ“˜ Weekly Assignment: Snakes and Ladders Game

The assignment was to **build a simple two-player Snakes and Ladders game** using Python. The game logic includes:

- **Using dictionaries** to define positions of snakes and ladders.
- **Rolling dice** using the `random` module.
- **Tracking player positions** and moving them based on dice rolls.
- **Handling snakes and ladders:**  
  - If a player lands on a ladder, they go up.  
  - If they land on a snake, they slide down.
- The first player to land exactly on **square 100** wins the game.

### ðŸ’¡ Features Implemented:

- Two players take turns rolling a die.
- Each playerâ€™s position updates based on the roll.
- Snakes and ladders affect player movement.
- Player must roll the exact number to reach position 100.
- The game announces the winner and ends when one player wins.

### ðŸ”§ Concepts Practiced:

- Control flow with `if-else` and `while` loops  
- Dictionaries and functions  
- Random number generation  
- Basic game logic and user interaction
