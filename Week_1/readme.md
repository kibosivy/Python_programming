# Week 1: Introduction to Python 🐍

This week marked the beginning of my Python programming journey. I was introduced to the core building blocks of the language and learned how to write simple yet powerful programs.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Variables, Expressions, and Statements**  
  Learned how to store and manipulate data using variables and basic operators.

- **Conditional Statements**  
  Explored `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions within programs.

- **Loops**  
  Practiced using `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions based on conditions.

- **Functions**  
  Wrote reusable code blocks with `def`, learned how to pass arguments and return results.

## 📁 Assignment: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

For the Week 1 assignment, I built a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game where:

- The computer randomly picks one of the three options using `random.choice()`.
- The user is prompted to enter their choice using `input()`.
- Both choices are compared using conditional statements to determine the winner.
- The result is printed out clearly.

### 💻 Key Concepts Practiced:
- `import`ing modules
- Using `input()` and `print()` for interaction
- `if-elif-else` logic for game rules
- Generating randomness with the `random` module

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

This assignment helped me apply all the Week 1 concepts in a real, interactive program. It was fun to build, and it showed how logical thinking and simple Python tools can be used to create games.
