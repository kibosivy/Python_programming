This Python Programming course has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming concepts, including variables, control flow, functions, data structures, and regular expressions. 

Iâ€™ve also gained hands-on experience with web scraping using BeautifulSoup, working with APIs and web services, and applying Object-Oriented Programming. 

In the final weeks, we explored databases, modules, packages, and writing unit tests. 

Each week included practical assignments that helped reinforce these concepts through real-world applications.
